# JavaScript-DiceRoll-Game
This is a little game i made to be played in the browser. It was part of a JavaScirpt tutourial, which also allowed me to use HTML and CSS to link it all together.

The game rules are as follows:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
